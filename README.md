## About the project
This project is a strict template for jump starting a Phaser project which uses Node.js for quicker development. I've used it as using npm with Phaser is a requirement of my L4 university project. All the code before this commit - commit 60816a4450c23bd06753c511b2d9ad3d4ee7e21a - was made by Jerga99. Since then I've edited the webpack to target a folder called docs instead of build so it can be used with Github Pages. I've also added code that makes the game screen in Phaser dynamic - meaning it will resize to fit any screen. The last thing I added was the code from the smartcontroller repository  (https://github.com/SmartControllerJS/SmartController) but this has been commented out as unless there is a game to use it with it has no real purpose.

### Built With

* [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Webpack.js](https://webpack.js.org/)

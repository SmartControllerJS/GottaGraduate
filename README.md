    Gotta Graduate! is a local multiplayer co-op game where you and your friends go through the lifecycle of university avoiding the casual, nonsensical hiccups that university life brings while also trying to pass each year, with the hopes of graduating. Avoid dropping out of university and ace your exams by working with and against your fellow classmates!

## About the project
Level 4 individual project: Interactive experiences for public spaces using smartphone remote controllers for user interaction [HTML, JavaScript, Smartphone, HCI].

I am creating an interactive game for a new university building being opened in 2022 called the Advanced Research Centre (ARC). The game will be available to play in public, outside the ARC, on a screen facing the street. A user will scan a QR code which will connect to their mobile phone and open a controller which they can use to play the game.

### Motivation of project
The motivation for this project is to explore how the use of a smartphone controller can create an interactive experience in a public context. Within this context, the users of the experience could be of any age, background, and career. This creates specific constraints that aren't present when the experience is a more typical, targeted indoor interactive experience.

The project revolves around the creation of a multiplayer game which will allow the users to interact and play with each other. It will allow for an engaging experience with no barrier of entry and hopefully let a wide audience take advantage of the experience.

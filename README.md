    Gotta Graduate! is a local multiplayer co-op game where you and your friends go through the lifecycle of university avoiding the casual, nonsensical hiccups that university life brings while also trying to pass each year, with the hopes of graduating. Avoid dropping out of university and ace your exams by working with and against your fellow classmates!

## About the project

Level 4 individual project: Interactive experiences for public spaces using smartphone remote controllers for user interaction [HTML, JavaScript, Smartphone, HCI].

I am creating an interactive game for a new university building being opened in 2022 called the Advanced Research Centre (ARC). The game will be available to play in public, outside the ARC, on a screen facing the street. A user will scan a QR code which will connect to their mobile phone and open a controller which they can use to play the game.

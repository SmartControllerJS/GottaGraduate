## About the project

Level 4 individual project: Interactive experiences for public spaces using smartphone remote controllers for user interaction [HTML, JavaScript, Smartphone, HCI].

I am creating an interactive game for a new university building being opened in 2022 called the Advanced Research Centre (ARC). The game will be available to play in public, outside the ARC, on a screen facing the street. A user will scan a QR code which will connect to their mobile phone and open a controller which they can use to play the game.
